      "A voucher token representing a claim on 1 oz of gold to be mined from the Buru project. It is redeemed over time into real assets or stablecoins.",
  },
  {
    question: "What backs KASH?",
    answer:
      "KASH is collateralized by vRWA(Gold), which is gradually replaced by USDT or gold-backed RWA as redemptions occur.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is KASH a stablecoin?",
    answer:
      "Not strictly. KASH is a reserve-backed asset â€” its price fluctuates around the reserve pool value but has mechanisms to support price stability.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who governs KASH?",
    answer:
      "The project is led by a foundation rather than a DAO, with plans to explore community governance participation in later phases.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can investors benefit?",
    answer:
      "Early participants in staking receive high-yield rewards as compensation for backing forward risk. KASH also gains utility as a DeFi collateral and reserve token.",
  },
